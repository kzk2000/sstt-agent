Working memory maintains current task context while filtering irrelevant information.
Long-term memory stores experiences that influence future decision-making patterns.
Episodic memory captures specific events that provide contextual understanding.
Semantic memory represents abstract knowledge that generalizes across situations.
Memory consolidation strengthens important connections while weakening unused pathways.
Retrieval cues trigger relevant memories that inform current reasoning processes.
Memory interference occurs when similar experiences conflict during recall.
Attention mechanisms select relevant information while suppressing distracting stimuli.
Context switching requires cognitive resources that temporarily reduce performance.
Memory decay affects older information that lacks reinforcement through repeated access.
