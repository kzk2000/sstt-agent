Code reviews reduce bugs by catching issues before deployment.
Automated testing increases confidence in releases while reducing manual effort.
Continuous integration catches integration issues early.
Documentation improves maintainability but requires ongoing effort to keep current.
Pair programming improves code quality by sharing knowledge between developers.
Technical debt accumulates when shortcuts are taken to meet deadlines.
Refactoring reduces technical debt but requires dedicated time allocation.
