Literature reviews establish foundational knowledge while identifying research gaps.
Hypothesis formation guides experimental design and methodology selection.
Data collection requires careful sampling to ensure representative results.
Statistical analysis reveals patterns that support or refute hypotheses.
Peer review improves research quality through expert evaluation and feedback.
Replication studies increase confidence in findings by validating results across contexts.
Publication bias affects knowledge advancement when negative results remain unpublished.
Interdisciplinary collaboration expands research scope while introducing methodological challenges.
Research ethics protects participants while ensuring scientific integrity.
Grant funding enables research projects but influences topic selection priorities.
