Semantic relationships connect concepts through meaningful associations.
Graph topology reveals structural patterns that indicate information centrality.
Node centrality measures importance based on connection density and traversal frequency.
Edge weights represent relationship strength while enabling weighted path calculations.
Knowledge provenance tracks information sources to establish credibility and context.
Temporal relationships capture sequence dependencies that influence causal reasoning.
Contextual embeddings enhance retrieval by incorporating situational relevance.
Graph traversal algorithms discover indirect connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.
Ontology alignment enables knowledge fusion across different domain representations.
Intentionality scoring prioritizes foreground concepts while filtering background noise.
