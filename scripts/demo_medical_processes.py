Patient symptoms guide initial diagnostic assessments.
Laboratory tests confirm or rule out suspected conditions.
Imaging studies reveal structural abnormalities that clinical examination cannot detect.
Differential diagnosis narrows possible conditions through systematic elimination.
Treatment protocols reduce symptom severity while minimizing adverse effects.
Patient monitoring tracks treatment response and identifies complications early.
Drug interactions increase risk of adverse events when multiple medications are prescribed.
Preventive care reduces disease incidence through early intervention strategies.
Medical history provides context that influences diagnostic accuracy.
